# Deploying-a-Scalable-Web-Application-on-AWS-with-Terraform
# Overview
This project leverages the power of AWS to create a robust and scalable web application. By using Terraform, we can manage our infrastructure as code, making it easy to deploy and manage resources consistently. The application is designed to handle variable loads, thanks to the Auto Scaling feature and the Application Load Balancer.
# Architecture
 * Amazon EC2: Virtual servers that host the web application.
 * Application Load Balancer (ALB): Distributes incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances to ensure high availability.
 * Auto Scaling: Automatically adjusts the number of EC2 instances based on demand.
